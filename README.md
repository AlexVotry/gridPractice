I wanted to create a grid system in Angular5.  

I will be doing a project that runs on three large screens. I wanted to create a
grid that would: </br>
  <b>first</b> separate into three monitors with space above and below so it will be properly
  proportioned on the monitors.</br>
  <b>second</b> create separate grids within each monitor. Each component html will have
  separate css to create the subgrids.</br>
  <b>third</b> make a clean html with each monitor clearly separated so anyone could
  make changes without tracing through files of code.
