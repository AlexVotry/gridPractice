I wanted to create a grid system in Angular5.  

I will be doing a project that runs on three large screens. I wanted to create a
grid that would:
  *first* separate into three monitors with space above and below so it will be properly
  proportioned on the monitors.
  *second* create separate grids within each monitor. Each component html will have
  separate css to create the subgrids.
  *third* make a clean html with each monitor clearly separated so anyone could
  make changes without tracing through files of code.
